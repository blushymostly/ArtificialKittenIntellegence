To publish to CF, you just need to add your [`CF_PROJECT_ID`](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf1eb689-ced9-475f-9cdc-f044699f3c2d) as a [variable](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69edf220-b1e8-4e71-aa2c-f43b4a302fef), and a [`RELEASE_TOKEN`](https://authors-old.curseforge.com/account/api-tokens) and a [`API_TOKEN`](https://support.curseforge.com/en/support/solutions/articles/9000208346-about-the-curseforge-api-and-how-to-apply-for-a-key#key) as secrets.
